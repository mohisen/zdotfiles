How to upgrade to KDE 4.10 in Kubuntu 12.04 or 12.10


Before adding the PPA, please note that according to the PPA description, the packages in the Kubuntu Backports PPA might not be tested enough yet, so you may encounter bugs!

The Kubuntu backports PPA provides the latest KDE SC 4.10 for (K)Ubuntu 12.10 and 12.04 (I've only tested it in Kubuntu 12.10). To add the PPA use the following commands:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports
sudo apt-get update

Then, open the Update Manager, make SURE all the packages are selected and install all the available updates. Alternatively, you can also upgrade using the following command (I've stopped using it in posts because on systems with broken packages it can remove packages that's not supposed to):
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade


If you're not using KDE - e.g. if you're using Unity or GNOME Shell, you can install KDE SC 4.10 (firstly, make sure you've added the PPA using the commands above) using the following command:
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
