    Neither gDebi, Synaptic or Lubuntu Software Center support handling the "apt://" protocol/links.

    But a very simple graphical apt-get-type installer called AptURL does.
        Install it with sudo apt-get install apturl
        Set Firefox Preferences to "Always Ask" for apt
        Click on a link, and select AptURL:

        And the window will pop open:

        Installation will take place using a lightweight gDebi-style frontend

    The other option is to use a custom script such as green7's answer

    But to be browser-independent, what you really need is:
        A .desktop file for your script/application, indicating that it handles the x-scheme-handler/apt protocol (see MimeType= lines in aptURL.desktop, ubuntu-software-center.desktop)
        And you can set the default by modifying the defaults.list file in /usr/share/applications/
