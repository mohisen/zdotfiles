Terra has definitely considered a full spectrum of usability, thus bringing a basic-yet-effective set of keyboard shortcuts, such as F12 (show/hide Terra), F11 (fullscreen mode), Quit (Ctrl+Q), Close page (Ctrl+W), Go to the next page (Ctrl+Right), Go to the previous page (Ctrl+Left).

By default, Terra occupies a third of the screen space, in order to resize it, hover over the mouse pointer over its bottom bar and drag it until a preferred size is reached.

How do we install Terra 0.1.2?
Add the following PPA (Precise, Quantal, Raring)

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ozcanesen/terra-terminal
