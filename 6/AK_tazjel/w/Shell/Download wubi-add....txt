Download wubi-add-virtual-disk, open a terminal and run:


sudo sh wubi-add-virtual-disk /home 15000
Where the first argument is the directory to move to a new dedicated disk, and the second argument is the size in MB.

You should now reboot. If you are happy with the result, you can now remove /home.backup. To undo the changes remove /home, copy rename /home.backup to /home and remove the /home line in /etc/fstab.

Note that contrary to previous information, this script is not suitable for moving /usr.

Experienced users may be able to do this manually, at own risk, following a process similar to that outlined in the file. (Do not rename /usr until the very last moment, as rsync is installed there.)

To move /usr try enter recovery mode after you run

sudo sh wubi-add-virtual-disk /usr 15000
and copy all folders in /usr.backup into new /usr and then fix sudo with

chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo
chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
How do I increase my swap space?
