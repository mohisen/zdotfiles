Synchronize with FTP/WebDAV (Windows)
FreeFileSync does not support accessing FTP volumes directly. But this functionality can be integrated by mapping the FTP web space to a drive letter: 
Example: Use the free utility NetDrive (http://www.netdrive.net) 

Add a "New Site" and specify site name, site URL, drive letter, account and password. 

Use the newly created drive as if it were a regular hard disk. 
Note:
Most FTP drives set a file's time stamp to the current time when synchronizing ignoring the source file's time and date. As a workaround you can do a "compare by filesize"; see corresponding section. 
Synchronize with SFTP (Linux)
An SFTP share can be easily mapped onto a local folder for use with FreeFileSync: 

Install:
sudo apt-get install sshfs 

Mount SFTP share:
sshfs ssh-account@ssh-server:[path] mountpoint 

Unmount:
fusermount -u mountpoint
