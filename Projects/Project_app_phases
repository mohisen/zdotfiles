The site went through four phases:

    A definition phase: where people defined what on and off-topic posts would look like.
    A commitment phase: where people committed and said they would actually use the site.
    A private beta: where those who committed gained access and started using the site.
    A public beta: same as private beta but with a wider audience.

At each phase, the the site had to prove it was worth going to the next phase. Finally after all of those steps, the site went "public" in October 2010 and was rebranded Ask Ubuntu.
