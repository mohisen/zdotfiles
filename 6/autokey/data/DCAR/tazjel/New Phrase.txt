(formerly GGR 346)

Student Comments

I want you to know how much I enjoyed this class. It was more work than some of my others but I liked it more anyway. It was really interesting and the "personal" touch you contributed by adding all of those photographs was really wonderful. I felt I got a true "feeling" for each section of the country. I can tell that you really enjoy what you do. Also, it is obvious that you put a tremendous amount of time into teaching this class. Also your audio files add to the class -- the lack of "connectedness" in on-line classes is a major downside for me, but with the addition your audios files helps to diminish that. Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for a terrific experience.

In this class so far, everything has been very well explained in terms of assignments, expectations and grading policies. Thanks for all the hardwork and dedication to this class even though it is online! You're efforts make this classes more enjoyable!

I love this class. It's well organized and very interesting. I like the incorporation of the ning web site along with the Wimba audio files.

I sure enjoy these field trips you've put out. Also, loved the Country /Rural Wisdom in chapter 8!

I wanted to let you know that I am completely impressed by the organization and set up of this course. After all the horror stories I've heard and been through myself with internet classes, I would say this is the best organized. Thank You.

Thank you for sharing some place and space with me in this disappearing distance! I absolutely loved this class and will enjoy our trip to the Grand Canyon for graduation all the more this friday. You do not need to reply to my last e-mail since all the 
grades are in. I do think that chapter 10 may need to be edited and broken down into two, maybe. It was a ton of information to try and remember or take notes on (just don't add another quiz, maybe a discussion assignment). My all time favorite chapter 
was the one on Hawaii... someday. I also want to say thanks for your accuracy and respect shown in the segments about the Latter-Day Saints. All in all, I hope to remember most of what I have learned and pass it on to my four children!

I just wanted to let you know I enjoyed the class.

The class has been a surprise to me. Being a web-based course I did not know how much I would learn. I am pleasantly surprised at how much I was able to learn from the class. I am glad I gave it a chance because the way you formatted the class I believe it was beneficial to my learning style. The only difficult thing for me was learning to set aside time in the beginning to get assignments done on time.

This has been a great experience for me and I have really enjoyed your class.

The class has gone by very quickly. I cannot believe it is almost complete. Of course I say this every semester. I am pleased with how much I was able to comprehend from the class. I had my doubts at the start of the semester about how much I would learn from a web-based class. I am glad I gave it a try. I also enjoyed taking a geography class. I had not had a geography class since 1978-79. I enjoyed the class.

Thanks for a great and challenging class.

I would like to thank you for your time this semester, I understand that web courses require a great deal of work for not only the students, but especially the instructor. You did a great job, and my interest in
geography was increased. Thanks.

I have really enjoyed your class.

Thank you for a wonderful class--I feel that I have learned a lot.

I really enjoyed the class! Thank you!

I would like to saw that I appreciate how organized this class was. It made my job as a student much easier.

I for one have enjoyed the class and it was fun to travel the United States in such a geographic manner.

While the class was quite time intensive it was very enjoyable and I did learn some new things that I had never heard of before. Thank you and your assistance for your time. Have a good summer!!

I have thoroughly enjoyed the coursework and especially the field trips. Hopefully I'll be able to visit a lot of those same places someday.

OLDER COMENTS - May Not Apply to the Current Version of the Class

- Dr. Lew, I know we don't have to check in this week but I just wanted to thank you for helping to broaden my horizons and open my eyes to the land around me. This last lesson was enriching and I was able to bring so much of my own experiences to it.

- Dr Lew - I enjoyed working on the final. I found a good web site on my home town. I was able to see that they are battling the loss of Sense of Place.

- Dr. Lew - Thank you for allowing me to be part of your class this fall. It was a different experience for me. Now my desire to visit all the states in this country has grown, but thanks to you, a state that I really want to see first, is Alaska.

- Dear Dr. Lew - ... I have nothing negative to say about this class. After earning two degrees, I will place this class in the category of "most challenging." It demanded a lot, which is exactly what a good class should do. I learned so much and feel that I will retain a lot of the information, because I was actively involved in learning it. I also feel that the feedback from you was faster and more "one-on-one" than it might have been in a traditional classroom. Thank you. If you ever need a recommendation for this method of teaching, let me know. I will continue to check for class messages during the last week. Again, thank you very much for presenting a challenging and interesting class.

- I really enjoyed your class and would highly recommend this class to Anyone interested. Have good and happy holidays, good luck in future classes.

- Well this is the last weekly check-up for the semester. I have really enjoyed taking this class. It was my first experience with an online class and I found it to be quit interesting. I also learned alot about the physical and social features of the U.S. Maybe someday down the line I'll have another class with you. Well have a good finals week and a happy holiday season. And stay safe.

- Dr. Lew - ... As my last checkin, I'd just like you to know that I have loved this class and had no idea a web class could be this much fun. Thanks so much for developing such great methods of teaching a class you never see. I love maps and learning about new places and your writings have really taught me so many new things. Thank you. I hope you have a wonderful holiday season!

- Thanks for teaching the class this semester.

- Thanks Dr. Lew for showing me that geography is more than just features on a map. The scope of geography is much deeper than I ever imagined. Thanks again.

- Dr Lew - I enjoy the format of this class quite a bit; but, I do miss the human interaction. I ran into a fellow GGR 346 student last night as we were both turning in our homework and found it nice to be able to discuss the class with someone. I appreciate the attention you have given me in this class as far as the trouble I have had with assignments getting there and such. You have been very helpful.

- Dr. Lew - Thanks for all of the feedback and constant communication throughout this class.

- Guess this is the last check in of the semester. Hope you have a wonderful holiday. I will be taking more geography in the future, in fact even though I don't need a minor (I am math education) I am close to one so am going to go ahead. So will probably see you around!

- Hello Dr. Lew - This semester has been better than I thought it would be, seeing as though all of my classes were on the internet. This was a totally new concept to me as the college I attended in Pennsylvania did not offer, nor did they accept, courses taken away from the classroom. It has been a relatively quick semester as well and I know that I have learned a lot. Tonight I was even able to help my daughter with her Geography homework with allowing her to use my book to explain the Louisiana Purchase and why Napoleon sold out. Thanks for a great semester!!!!!

- Just wanted to say that I have enjoyeed your class. I will take another online class for sure.

- Dear Dr. Lew - The topics we have studied throughout this class have given me a better understanding of geography - not so much landform geography - but cultural and economic. Thanks for the interesting learning forum.

- Dr. Lew - ... I really like the www.orksheets on the web page. I wish that all the assignments where like that in some way. I t would be nice if the weekly homework was a series of questions embedded in the text itself, like the www.orksheet.
