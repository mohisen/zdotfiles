# The script returns the number of new mails in a popup using notify-send. This is cool when you use a key-binding to 
# invoke the script. You will be able to see how many new mails you have at any time and during any task, without having 
# to open up a browser.

#Download the script with the link at the bottom of the page, copy it to your ~/bin or place it somewhere else in your #$PATH. Make it executable and it will be ready for use. enjoy!
