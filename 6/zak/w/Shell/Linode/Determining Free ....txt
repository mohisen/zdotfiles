Determining Free Memory and Swap Activity

You can use the following command to display memory use on your Linode:
# 
free -m

You can use the following snippet to see a list of your running processes sorted by memory use:
# 
ps -eo pmem,pcpu,rss,vsize,args | sort -k 1 -r | less

To see IO activity on your VPS, you may use the following command (you may need to install the sysstat package under Debian or Ubuntu first):

iostat -d -x 2 5
