colo <colourscheme1>  "default
autocmd! BufEnter,BufNewFile *.html,*.vim,*xml colo <colourscheme2>
autocmd! BufLeave *.html,*.vim,*xml colo <colourscheme1>

And of course you can modify the list of file extensions as you wish. The colourscheme will be <colourscheme1> by default, or <colourscheme2> if you open (or switch to) any of the specified types, and will revert to <colourscheme1> when you open (or switch to) any other type within a Vim session.

Hope this helps.
