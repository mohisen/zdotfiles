Definition:
A grouping of words based on the way they function in a syntactic structure--i.e., a syntactic pattern. Verb: colligate.

As linguist Ute RÃ¶mer has observed, "What collocation is on a lexical level of analysis, colligation is on a syntactic level. The term does not refer to the repeated combination of concrete word forms but to the way in which word classes co-occur or keep habitual company in an utterance" (Progressives, Patterns, Pedagogy, see below).
