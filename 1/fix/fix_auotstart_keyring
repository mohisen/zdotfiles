sudo vim  /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop



WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /tmp/keyring pkcs11: No such file or directory

THIS FIX MAKES THE gnome-keyring-pkcs11.so LOAD AT STARTUP FOR THE LXDE SESSION

This is one of them, now fixed....Warning message, it's an error message cause it is not letting the command to run. "WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /tmp/keyring-<SOMEGENERATEDSTRING>/pkcs11: No such file or directory "This is caused because of a module: gnome-keyring-pkcs11.so that is not being loaded when you log into an LXDE session. (this problem is analog to other sessions too, in this case I am using LXDE but could be KDE, GNOME etc... see the solution to understand how).



Here is the FIX!!!:

add "LXDE;" (without the double quotes and plus the semicolon, didn't try without it) 
to this file "/etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop"  by editing it with whatever text editor you preffer, I'll use "nano" 

1 - in a terminal type (as root or with sudo): nano /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
