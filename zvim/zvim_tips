Number all the lines in a file (insert line number followed by a tab):
:%s/^/\=line('.')."\t"/
Number a range of lines (from line 10 to line 20):
:10,20s/^/\=line('.')."\t"/
Number a range of lines sequentially starting from 1:
:let counter=0|10,20g//let counter=counter+1|s/^/\=counter."\t"
Number all the paragraphs in range starting from 1 (assuming the paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines):
:let counter=0|1,20g/^$\n^\s*[^\s]/let counter=counter+1|+1s/^/\=counter."\t"
Note: The above command does not work for the first paragraph in the file if there is no blank line above it.
