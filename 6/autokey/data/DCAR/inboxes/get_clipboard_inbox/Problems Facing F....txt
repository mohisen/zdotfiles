Problems Facing Forensic Linguists
"[There are] certain problems facing an insider forensic linguist. Eight such problems are:
1. short time limits imposed by a law case, as opposed to the more familiar time limits enjoyed in everyday academic pursuits;
2. an audience almost totally unfamiliar with our field;
3. restrictions on what we can say and when we can say it;
4. restrictions on what we can write;
5. restrictions on how to write;
6. the need to represent complex technical knowledge in ways that can be understood by people who know nothing of our field while maintaining our role as experts who have deep knowledge of these complex technical ideas;
7. constant changes or jurisdictional differences in the field of law itself; and
8. maintaining an objective, non-advocacy stance in a field in which advocacy is the major form of presentation."
