the sixad driver needs 'hcid' to work, which conflicts with the regular bluetooth.

but, if you have 2 bt adapters, I guess you can make them work separately.

the steps should be:
1 - set (normal) bluetooth device as hci1 (leaving default hci0 for sixaxis).
(you should have a GUI for this...)
2 - connect the sixaxis using these commands:
$ sudo modprobe uinput
$ sudo hcid -n # will not close (ignore errors about config file)
$ sudo sixad-bin 0 0 # 1st argument for DEBUG, 2nd is LEGACY_MODE

press ps button, and it should work.

let me know how it goes
