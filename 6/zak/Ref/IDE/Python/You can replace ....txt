You can replace '<img src="/myapp/static/images/shapes/star1.png" />' with one of the following two options:

XML('<img src="/myapp/static/images/shapes/star1.png" />')

IMG(_src='/myapp/static/images/shapes/star1.png')

Also, it is generally preferable to use the URL() function to generate outgoing URLs. With that replacement, the above two options would change to:

XML('<img src="' + URL('static', 'images/shapes/star1.png') + '" />')

IMG(_src=URL('static', 'images/shapes/star1.png'))
