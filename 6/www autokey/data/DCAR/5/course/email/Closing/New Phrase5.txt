    Dear Mr McAdam,

    With reference to your last email regarding the current situation with the Skipton Airport Project, I can confirm the following:

    We successfully completed stage 2 on Monday and at present we are preparing to start stage 3. On the whole, the project is going well. We have not encountered any problems with the machinery but there are still some minor issues with the delivery system. As was pointed out in our last meeting, the problem with the delivery system is due to the software. It is a very common software issue and we just need time to correct the code. Rest assured that this issue is being looked into and we are confident that it will be resolved by the end of the month.

    Please accept my apologises for not receiving a copy of the updated Project Report earlier. Please find attached a copy of the report below:

    Concerning your question about the post-installation support package, I can confirm that we provide both remote and call-out site support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This covers remote monitoring, a service every 3 months, service engineer visits and the cost of all parts and labour.

    With regards to your request to extend the period of post-installation support from 6 months to 12 months. May I suggest that we discuss this matter at the next project update meeting?

    I hope that this answers your questions.

    If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me on my mobile, 07340 7602133.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Yours sincerely,



    David Mitchell
    Project Manager
