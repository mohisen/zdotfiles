Collocations Involving the Word /?allaah/ ‘God’ in Modern Standard Arabic: A Corpus-Based Study
by Hassan Gadalla
This paper informs about a corpus-based study of the collocations including the word for God in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The study attempts to answer three questions: (a) What are the collocations including the word /?allaah/ ‘God’ in MSA? (b) How many are such collocations and which are the most frequent of them, and (c) How can these collocations be classified syntactically and semantically? It depends on the online corpus collected by Al-Sulaiti (2006) and the concordance program prepared by Roberts (2004). It starts with a brief introduction to collocations in Arabic and corpus studies. Then, it shows how Arabic collocations have been classified in the literature. Section (3) explains the study aim and technique. Section (4) presents an analysis of the results of the study by discussing the various syntactic and semantic categories of collocations found in the corpus. The results of this study can be useful in the fields of translation, lexicography and language pedagogy.
