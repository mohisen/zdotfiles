"When conducting empirical research, the researcher's primary responsibility is to provide evidence to support his or her claim about the relationship between the variables described in the research hypothesis. . . . [T]he researcher must collect data that will convince us of the accuracy of his or her predictions."
(Bart L. Weathington et al., Research Methods for the Behavioral and Social Sciences. John Wiley, 2010)
