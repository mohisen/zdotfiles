"According to Firth (1968:181), colligation refers to the relations between words at the grammatical level, i.e. the relations of 'word and sentence classes or of similar categories' instead of 'between words as such.' But nowadays the term colligation has been used to refer not only to significant co-occurrence of a word with grammatical classes or categories (e.g. Hoey 1997, 2000; Stubbs 2001c:112) but also to significant co-occurrence of a word with grammatical words (e.g. Krishnamurthy 2000). The patterning with grammatical words, of course, can be observed and computed even using a raw corpus."
