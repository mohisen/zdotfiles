 have an archive of a bunch of drivers, but this is the one I’ve used:

ads/ps3-sixaxis-win32-driver

1. Install the filter driver (libusb-win32-filter-bin-0.1.10.1.exe).
2. Unpack ps3sixaxis_en.exe
3. Plug the SIXAXIS into your PC.
4. Run ps3sixaxis_en.exe once. (Whenever you connect it.)
5. Push the PS button on the SIXAXIS once if it doesn’t see it straight away.
!***Hurry up and press PS button immediately upon execution before the window closes.***!

I find it helpful to have the controller CPL open to see if it takes. Also, to reassign keys.
