                 If you upgraded Xubuntu to 12.04, and getting that error.
                 Edit /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop file
                 You need to edit it as root or using sudo.
                 Look for a line that looks like :
                 OnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;

                 after ; (semicolon) … add XFCE
                 so it looks like => OnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;XFCE;

                 reboot the computer…
