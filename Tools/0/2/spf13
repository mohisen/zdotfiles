                                                      spf13-vim is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, Gvim and MacVim.
                                                      
                                                      It is a good starting point for anyone intending to use VIM for development running equally well on Windows, Linux, *nix and Mac.
                                                      
                                                      The distribution is completely customisable using a ~/.vimrc.local and ~/.vimrc.bundles.local Vim RC files.
                                                      
                                                      
                                                      
                                                      Unlike traditional VIM plugin structure, which similar to UNIX throws all files into common directories, making updating or disabling plugins a real mess, spf13-vim 3 uses the Vundle plugin management system to have a well organized vim directory (Similar to mac's app folders). Vundle also ensures that the latest versions of your plugins are installed and makes it easy to keep them up to date.
                                                      
                                                      Great care has been taken to ensure that each plugin plays nicely with others, and optional configuration has been provided for what we believe is the most efficient use.
                                                      
                                                      Lastly (and perhaps, most importantly) It is completely cross platform. It works well on Windows, Linux and OSX without any modifications or additional configurations. If you are using MacVim or Gvim additional features are enabled. So regardless of your environment just clone and run.
                                                      
                                                      spf13-vim 3.0
                                                      January 2012 spf13-vim released it's third major iteration. This is important as it requires a reinstall, but trust me it's worth it.
                                                      
                                                      The biggest change is the switch from using git submodules to using the excellent Vundle system. While git submodules seemed like a good idea at the time, it wasn't. It was always problematic. Additionally because a submodule points to a refspec and not a branch, it was a constant maintenance nightmare to keep everything up to date.
                                                      
                                                      Vundle has an excellent system built on the same principles as Pathogen, but with an integrated plugin management system that is Git and Github aware.
                                                      
                                                      We have also changed out most of the plugins in favor of newer more stable alternatives. Additionally we have significantly reduced the number of plugins requiring python or ruby.
                                                      
                                                      The goal has always been to add functionality without changing all the features, functionality and keystrokes we all love. Using spf13-vim we've kept all the default behaviors (by and large), so if you ever find yourself on a vanilla environment you'll feel right at home.

                                                      Linux, *nix, Mac OSX Installation
                                                      The easiest way to install spf13-vim is to use our automatic installer by simply copying and pasting the following line into a terminal. This will install spf13-vim and backup your existing vim configuration. If you are upgrading from a prior version (before 3.0) this is also the recommended installation.
                                                      
                                                          curl http://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L > spf13-vim.sh && sh spf13-vim.sh
                                                          If you have a bash-compatible shell you can run the script directly:

                                                              On Windows and *nix Git and Curl are required. Also, if you haven't already, you'll need to install Vim.

                                                              After installation try running git --version within command prompt (press Win-R, type cmd, press Enter) to make sure all good:

                                                              The easiest way is to download and run the spf13-vim-windows-install.cmd file. Remember to run this file in Administrator Mode if you want the symlinks to be created successfully.

                                                              The simpliest (and safest) way to update is to simply rerun the installer. It will completely and non destructively upgrade to the latest version.
                                                              
                                                                  curl http://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L -o - | sh

If anything has changed with the structure of the configuration you will need to create the appropriate symlinks.
