Introduction and basic configuration

The virtual console (keyboard mapping, console font, and console map) is configured in /etc/vconsole.conf. It defines what keymap the keyboard is in the virtual consoles. Keytable files are provided by the kbd package. An example /etc/vconsole.conf is shown below:

/etc/vconsole.conf

KEYMAP=us
FONT=lat9w-16
FONT_MAP=8859-1_to_uni

Note: As of systemd-194, the built-in kernel font and the us keymap are used if KEYMAP= and FONT= are empty or not set.

Another way to set the keyboard mapping (keymap) is using localectl:

# localectl set-keymap de

localectl can also be used to set the X11 keymap:

# localectl set-x11-keymap de

See man 1 localectl and man 5 vconsole.conf for details.
Keyboard layouts

This is the list of known keymap settings to work for the corresponding keyboard layouts. Most keymaps can be found in the /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/layout (layout=qwerty, azerty, dvorak, etc.) directory.

Less common but nonetheless useful keymaps for Arch Linux are found in the /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/architecture (architecture=mac, sun, etc.) directory.

You can find more info about your keyboard layout with: less /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
Note:

    In an X session, you can use setxkbmap to instantly apply keyboard layout: setxkbmap -layout dvorak
    You can also use this method to modify single keys. This command would assign the compose functionality to the caps lock key: setxkbmap -option 'compose:caps'. This allows for example to write umlauts easily. Example for Umlaut A: CAPSLOCK, ", A -> Ã„. You can also configure the right Windows key as a Compose key with setxkbmap -option 'compose:rwin'
    If these keymaps do not work for you, make sure the keymap file exists in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ using find: find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ -name "*[your desired keymap]*"
    You can see some instructions on how to use some keymaps in their respective files with: zless /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/.../.../xx.map.gz

Configuring the console keymap

    cd /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty.
    Copy your default keymap (us.map.gz) to a new file personal.map.gz.
    gunzip the new map file.
    Edit personal.map using your favorite editor. Examples:
        Make the Right Alt key same as Left Alt key (Emacs)
        change the line include "linux-with-alt-and-altgr" to include "linux-with-two-alt-keys".
        Swap CapsLock with Escape (Vim)
        make keycode 1 = Caps_Lock and keycode 58 = Escape.
        Make CapsLock another Control key
        change the line keycode 58 = Caps_Lock to keycode 58 = Control.
        Swap CapsLock with Left Control key
        make keycode 29 = Caps_Lock and keycode 58 = Control. 
    gzip the map file.
    Change the default keyboard layout file that will be used by editing /etc/vconsole.conf (you might have to create this file) and changing the line that says KEYMAP=us to KEYMAP=personal.
    Reboot to use your keymap the way nature intended (or run "loadkeys personal").
