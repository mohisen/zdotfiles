 Fillmore, Kay and O'Connor encapsulate the lexical nature of fixed expressions when they describe them as:"â€¦phenomena larger than words, which are like words in that they have to belearned separately as individual facts about pieces of the language, but whichalso have grammatical structure [and] interact in important ways with the restof the language." (Fillmore
et al.
1988:501)
