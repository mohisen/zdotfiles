Definition:

Colligation is a type of collocation, but where a lexical item is linked to a grammatical one. Surprising, amazing and astonishing are nearly synonymous. We can say it is astonishing/surprising/amazing, but we tend to say it is not surprising and not the others- surprising colligates with the negative.
