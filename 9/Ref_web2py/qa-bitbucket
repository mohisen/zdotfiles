# `GTD.project(WIP)

QA-Stack is a dynamic web application created using the python programming language under the web2py framework. QA-Stack aims to provide an easy-to-use, simple and elegant questions and answers (Q&A) application for the Open Source community. It was originally aimed to be a Q&A application solely for python questions and projects, but it evolved into a more general-purpose Q&A application. QA-Stack is released as Open Source under the Simplified BSD license (Included in this software package). You are free to download, copy and modify the source code, providing that you keep mentions of the author within the code. Happy hacking.
