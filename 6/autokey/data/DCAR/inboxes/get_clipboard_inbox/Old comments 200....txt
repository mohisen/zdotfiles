Class: Spring 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

This is the best class I have ever taken, it has introduced me to new certification opportunities, techniques and perspectives on the internet world. In addition I've learned more useful information from this course in two weeks than I have from all of my years of existence on this planet. This feedback form itself is testament, its the first I have seen of a graphic based spam filter. Not for the easily frightened or those who like to believe the world is safe, because you will learn, its not.

Class: Spring 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

awesome class. I always look forward to learning something new during each lecture;

Class: Spring 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

This class was what i have been waiting for. It's good and i hope it would continue for a long time. New students should and must take this classes with all seriousness.

Class: Summer 2007 - CNIT 30: Internet Safety

This class rocks! Professor Sam Browne not only knows what he is teaching, but knows how to teach well also. First of all, he is friendly and makes student feel like they belong there! He does not have arrogance in his teaching, and wants students to learn. Unlike traditional college style teaching, He is very straight forward in his teaching, and on the point. He brings his subject matter into practicality. For example, out of many subject matters he taught, he taught about zombie machines and how criminals take over innocent people's computer. Then he tied it with interesting actual statistics of how many computers are actually taken over. His nice personality, coupled with great teaching style and format really made me even more eager to learn this stuff. Before I took the course, computer stuff was really boring for me. But after after taking the course with the professor, thanx to him, I am interested in computers now.

The valuable lab lessons greatly enhances learning, I recommend anyone who wants to learn anything about computers to take Professor Sam Browne.

Keep up the Good work, Professor Browne!

Class: Summer 2007 - Working Connections in Frisco, Texas: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

The class was awesome! If you have never taken one Mr. Bowne's classes - do so! You won't regret it.

Class: Spring 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

This is a really fascinating course. I read the lecture notes online, learned a remarkable amount of stuff. I'm no computer genius, but at least I understand a bit more about computer security. Thanks Professor, it was fascinating! Bob B.

Class: Fall 2007 - CNIT 335: Windows Vista Tech Support

The class is OK; the teacher's lectures are very good. He speaks fast but there's a lot to be gained from his lectures and his thorough knowledge in things technical make him a great teacher with generally good answers, even to questions not totally related to the course.

Class: Fall 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

Great class, the projects are very informative and interesting. I learned a lot of new technologies and techniques following the projects. Sam is a knowledgeable and helpful lecturer and I enjoyed the way he put the class together.If there were a couple of things I would suggest they would be as follows:For evening lectures start them 6 and try to cover the material by the break whenever possible. I found that the class material could almost always be covered in the space on 1 hour and hope that in future the first hour of the lecture focuses on pushing through the material so that those of us that work during the day can return home to work on labs or read.The second observation is that there a number of students in the class who seemed to be lacking basic technology skills. Listening to people asking ridiculous questions during class (on a continual basis) was very frustrating as it dragged out lectures and broke the flow of Sam's lectures. Hopefully next class some of these folks will be weeded out.

hi all,I m a Computer science student from India.I m looking at the materials and projects posted on this site andI must say they are quite "impressive". Especially i liked the kind of projects that Mr.Bowne has put.thank u Mr.Sam BowneAbhishek kumarGoa universityIndia

I volunteer for a local charity doing Network Admin in England . The budget for training is nil .In fact, the budget for everything is nil !! I have A, 70-270, but remembering chunks of text is not a substitute for hands on experience. Your class has been invaluable to me in that I can test our Network Security both actively and defensively using the methodstools you have clearly defined. Sam , I have no doubt that your class has helped to significantly improve our online safety and my practical skills. I just wanted to thank you for producing this Ethics class in Computer Security .

Class: Spring 2008 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

I would highly recommend this course to any computer user with intermediate skills. The lectures were interesting and full of information. The lab was a great place to get hands-on experience on what programs exist to circumvent machines and suggestions on how to better defend your computers and networks from hack attacks. The projects were engaging, covering the full gamut of hacking. I feel fortunate that I had the opportunity to take this class what with there being few, if any, courses available that focus on hacking and preventative measures to take to minimize unauthorized intrusions. Mr. Bowne is an invaluable asset to the CNIT department.

Class: Fall 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

Great class, plenty of organized hands on labprojects. Lots to learn from a niceknowledgeable instructor.

Class: Fall 2007 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

This is a great class, you can really learn a lot from it. If you're working or planning to work for IT it is absolutely necessary to take this class.

Class: Spring 2008 - CNIT 335: Windows Vista Tech Support

Study for the quizzes. Do as well as you can on them because the points will accrue. Do the projects, especially if you don't have any experience supporting an operating system. Sam is an amazing knowledge base and can discuss subjects that extend beyond the computing enviroment. If you have the chance to take one of his courses I highly recommend you not miss the opportunity. I really enjoyed the experience and will definately take a class from him in the future. Thanks for being an uber cool instructor!

THIS THE BEST NETWORK SECURITY CLASS I HAVE EVER HAD, SAM IS A GOOD TEACHER AND A GOOD PERSON.DONT THINK TWICE JUST SIGN UP.

Class: Fall 2008 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

i am taking several CNIT classes, but this one gives the most hands on, compared to CNIT 106 and CNIT 130 form different lecturers.some of the stuff is a bit beyond my understanding due to little or no knowledge in Linuxscripting but the rest is pure FUN. keep it coming SAM!!! so, advise, to fully appreciate this class take Linux and networking class before.hope that helped:)

Class: Spring 2009 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

It's fun, you should take it. The teacher is really helpful!

Class: Spring 2009 - CNIT 120: Network Security

Good class. Sam's tops. Dedicated, comprehensive, does a great job on everything. Count the ways? has email acct he answers. Follows the schedule and syllabus almost to a T. Has interesting guest speakers. Treats everyone like adults, even the 11th graders. Scores the weekly quizzes, with comments, and a typed sheet, stapled to tests w. correct answers. Has a v. current webpage w. relevant, interesting links relating to the class topic. Even when it doesn't fit into the class's niche, it's usually extremely interesting. The extra credit that involves outside of campus are usually found by him, and he arranges for students to have free access to killer industry conferences. Has a v. congenial manner, and great personality pluses. He's soft-spoken, polite, considerate, pensive, quick-thinking, deferential to students, very tolerant to interruptions by students. Answers all questions. Since he comes from the field of physics, he lets his scientific proclivities spill over into his I.T. lectures and websites. And since he was highly successful in physics, his rapid, methodical problem-solving skills are a sight to behold. One of the most fascinating parts of his lectures are if you arrive ten minutes early. He goes through links of interesting related news. He also seems to be highly, highly sensitive, even in ideological and political matters. Dr. Bowne is a boon to the college, and CCSF has added another inspired, inspiring educator, thrilled by what he's doing. Take any of his classes.

Hello, My name is Jack. I am a Student Assistant at Farmingdale State College in New York. Enrolled in a Major called Security Systems. My goal is to get more hands on labs into this program. I stumbled upon your web site and think it is awesome. You must be an awesome professor, I know because I've watched some of your videos. Keep up the great work and thanks for some ideas on improving my major and the students goals of becoming information security professionals. If you have any advice you can email me at jackdcongmail.com Thank you so much.

I'm watching the videos of cnit 123. They are great. I have always wondered how hacking is possible. Being in the electronic industry, I have electronic knowledge, but I never thought about how it could be used like this. If nothing else, these lectures are teaching me how to expand my thinking about how things are done. Thanks for your lectures. They are inspirational.

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 335: Windows Vista Tech Support

Sam, Your class is very interesting and you make it even more interesting. Your knowledge on the subjects is impressive. I really enjoyed your class and i'm looking forward to enroll in one of you other class. THANK YOU

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 10: Careers in Computer Networking

Thank you for offering CNIT 10. It was one of the most usefulclasses in computers that I have ever taken and has set me on the path to a career.

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 106: Intro to Networking

I love your class, but this computer lab thing is ridiculous. I have now spent countless hours trying to restore functionality to about 5 lab computers. 2, 3, and 4 have had admin privileges locked out of the student accounts and TED has the only admin rights on 4. I lost project 15 because Ted has locked up the administrator privileges.It's no wonder I can't get this homework done on time. 30 minutes for the project. 2 hours to fix the problems the students created. I could spend that 2 hours fixing my own network.Maybe I could help you develop some computer lab rules? Stephanie Nuttman

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 106: Intro to Networking

I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to not only learnso many new things about computer networking technology, but to havelearned it from someone who obviously loves what they do!You inspire with no effort at all, which in my book, many are called to do,few accomplish it.Without taking up too much of your time, it's just important for me to conveyto you that this was an extremely tough year personally. It was your class thatI looked forward to most and you never showed up with less than your BEST. Iam certain beyond doubt when I say our entire class appreciated that.Whatever is next for you, I wish you the absolute best. If you keep doing whatyou are doing, you'll be amazing...Dare to reach any higher and you'll be extraordinary...

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 202E: Routing Protocols and Concepts

Sam's a _great_ teacher. Take the class! Expect though, to have to spend some time studying... somewhat difficult to do full time IT job and this at the same time.

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 106: Intro to Networking

Hi everyone!I took CNIT106 with Professor Bowne and he is great!I learned a lot,it prepared me good enough for the Cisco classes and he really knows what he is teaching!Great teacher and great class (CNIT106)!I suggest everyone to take it!

Class: Fall 2009 - CNIT 201E: Network Fundamentals

If your serious about an education Sam is the man. If we had more teachers like him the world would be a better place. His enthusiasm is contagious. He loves what he does and it shows. Keep up the great work............

Class: Spring 2010 - CNIT 335: Windows Vista Tech Support

Reprimanding students for suggesting that class time be used for class related activities (such as studying for a quiz vs. going over links describing how Apple is trying to put another company out of business with bogus patent litigation, or TX's retarded views on social studies) seems rather uncouth.Nor did I ever say that I had a problem with you going over the linkscurrent events. In fact, the problem is that they are so interesting that it's impossible to use class time I've paid for to study.I don't think it was an unreasonable suggestion to give your students 10 mins to study before class formally begins (like in that limbo between 6 and 6:10). But I will concede the point on the grounds that strictly speaking, students should be prepared by the time they get to class.All that being said, your shirts are awesome, and that is also worth noting (at least to me).

Class: Spring 2010 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

I took this class last semester and really enjoyed it. Sam is an excellent lecturer and also takes time to help students out in finishing projects when they run into problems. His quizzes are difficult, so make sure to spend a lot of time studying. You learn a lot in his classes.

Class: Spring 2010 - CNIT 123: Ethical Hacking and Network Defense

I want to thank you for letting me monitor your Saturday class. I learned a lot and I am extremely happy that I was in your class. The material was great, the homework exercises were extremely helpful, and the wealth of information that you presented was excellent. I am usually a Saturday late sleeper, but this semester I could not wait to get up early and get to your class. Once again, thank you.I hope to take other classes from you in the future.

Class: Fall 2010 - CNIT 121: Computer Forensics

Sam's classes are as good as it gets at City College, he clearly enjoys teaching and interacting with students. This responsiveness in class does not seem to extend to email. He says that he reads his email, but do not expect an answer or even an acknowledgment to emails that you send him. Too busy I guess.

Class: Fall 2010 - CNIT 106: Intro to Networking

Sam is a very educated teacher but hold on tight caus he moves fast.

Class: Fall 2010 - CNIT 201E: Network Fundamentals

One of the best classes I have taken. Sam makes the material relevant and interesting by tying classroom concepts with real life applications. He spends time getting students up to date with the latest related news, which I find tremendously useful. I have learned a lot in this class and will take subsequent classes that Sam is teaching at CCSF.

Class: Fall 2010 - 345: Windows 7 Tech Support

It is a great class. I have learned a lot from both of his lectures and home work assignments through the course. It has a lot of work (assignments and quizes); but it's totally worth it. I highly recommended to take any of his class or classes. He is a Great Professor!!!

Class: Fall 2010 - 345: Windows 7 Tech Support

Do not let this valuable learning resource slip away !! Take all his classes and you will have a very solid base in computer networking, security, and operating systems. What a gem of an instructor, helps any way he can, always available, superior knowledge of all things computer. That being said you must work as the course materials are involved. If you like multiple choice quizzes or an easy A go else where. If you want to learn, you have just entered the SWEET ZONE. Up ahead on a sign post...the Crystal Clear Zone.

Class: Fall 2010 - 345: Windows 7 Tech Support

Excellent class offering the basics in Windows 7 support. Sam is a superb instructor who takes an active roll in presenting new information (sometimes just days old), specifically surrounding the security aspects of nearly every version of the Windows OS. If you want to get into network security, Sam is valuable resource. I highly recommend taking any of his classes!One caveat is that this class will not fully prepare you to take Microsoft's Window 7 Configuring support test (Exam 70-680). You'll have to study additional material if you intend on taking it.

Class: none

Dear Mr. Bowne,I've recently been introduced to your defcon talks via google and I just wanted you to know you're doing a great job. You're one of the most engaging talkers and even when the material you're covering is not new to me, I can't help but smile at the sound of excitement in your voice. You sir, are a true hacker.If you're interested in EMR interception exploits, check out the next couple of issues of 2600 magazine. It's an incredible field of security breaching but one with far too little public information.With 30 in simple electronics parts and a program I wrote in a couple days I can remotely log keystrokes of a PS2 keyboard and there's absolutely no software solution, and it's 100 passive (read, undetectable), and to be totally honest I was scared shit-less when I realized I had gotten that sort of black magic to work in under a week.But I digress, look into the exciting world of "van eck phreaking", it's low tech meets high tech, it's simple to do (maybe even simple enough to teach a class) and it's scary powerful.Cheers,Triscal Islington

Class: Fall 2010 - CNIT 106: Intro to Networking

Sam is a great teacher the way he explains the material makes it super easy to understand . At the same time don't expect an easy A if you are not doing the projects he assigns ( which are all really cool hands on projects and give a lot of experience in real networking situations ) . His lectures are fast paced and straight to the point but also leave a lot of room for student questions and explanations on things that are unclear . Generally great class with great teacher I strongly recommend taking it for anybody interested in how your Internet works !
