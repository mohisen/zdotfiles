From source

You can pull the code from git or get a tagged tarball.

$ git clone git://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl.git
$ cd uzbl
[ $ git checkout origin/experimental ] # optional. see below
$ make
$ sudo make install
If you want to remove uzbl again, you can issue:

$ make uninstall
Tarballs can be pulled from github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/downloads

Though you can only get tagged versions from the master branch, which may be older then what you'll have through git.

If you want the specific subprojects, you can issue:

$ sudo make install-uzbl-core
$ sudo make install-uzbl-browser
$ sudo make install-uzbl-tabbed
