Writing an email

Emails, whether for business or social reasons, are usually written in a more informal style than letters.

You should always give your email a Subject, which should summarise its purpose in a few words.

The conventions for starting business emails vary, although it is quite common to use first names for both business and personal emails if you know the recipient.

It is not necessary to use Dear, although some people prefer to do this.

Generally speaking, the content of business emails should be brief and to the point.

If you are including any attachments, make sure to mention it in the text of your email.

To close a personal email, you can use the same expressions as for informal letters.

The conventions for closing business emails vary, but phrases such as the following are appropriate:
Regards,	
Kind regards,	
Best regards,	
With kind regards,	

In business emails, you should also include your full name, organisation, and contact details at the end.
