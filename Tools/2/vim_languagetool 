This plugin integrates the LanguageTool grammar checker into Vim. 
Current version of LanguageTool can check grammar in many languages 
See the list of supported languages: http://www.languagetool.org/languages/ 
or http://www.languagetool.org/ or more information about LanguageTool. 

The script defines 2 commands: 

* Use  :LanguageToolCheck  to check grammar in current buffer. 
  This will check for grammar mistakes in text of current buffer 
  and highlight the errors. It also opens a new scratch window with the 
  list of grammar errors with further explanations for each error. 
  Pressing <Enter> in scratch buffer will jump to that error. The 
  location list for the buffer being checked is also populated. 
  So you can use location commands such as :lopen to open the location 
  list window, :lne to jump to the next error, etc. 

* Use  :LanguageToolClear  to remove highlighting of grammar mistakes, 
  close the scratch window containing the list of errors, clear and 
  close the location list.

Bugs:   
  Column number reported by LanguageTool indicating the location of the 
  error is sometimes incorrect. There is an opened ticket about this bug: 
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3054895&group_id=110216&atid=655717 
  The script currently works around it by doing pattern matching with   
  information context but it is not a perfect workaround: it can cause 
  spurious highlighting of errors in rare cases. This bug is fixed in 
  LanguageTool-1.8.

install details
Install the plugin with: 

  $ mkdir ~/.vim 
  $ cd ~/.vim 
  $ unzip /path-to/LanguageTool.zip 
  $ vim -c 'helptags ~/.vim/doc' 

You also need to install the Java LanguageTool program in order to use 
this plugin. There are 3 possibilities: 

1/ Download the latest official stand-alone version of LanguageTool 
   (file LanguageTool-stable.zip) from http://www.languagetool.org/ 
   Unzip it. This should extract LanguageTool.jar among several other files 

2/ Or download an unofficial nightly build available at: 
   http://www.languagetool.org/download/snapshots/ 

3/ Or download the latest LanguageTool from subversion and build 
   it. This ensures that you get the latest version. On Ubuntu, you need 
   to install the maven, openjdk-7-jdk and subversion packages as a 
   prerequisite: 

   $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk maven subversion 

   LanguageTool can then be downloaded and built as follows: 

   $ svn co https://languagetool.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/languagetool/trunk/JLanguageTool languagetool 
   $ cd languagetool 
   $ mvn package 

   This should build the command line version of LanguageTool: 
   
   ./languagetool-standalone/target/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/languagetool-commandline.jar 

You then need to set up g:languagetool_jar in your ~/.vimrc with 
the location of this LanguageTool.jar file. For example: 
   
  let g:languagetool_jar='$HOME/languagetool/languagetool-standalone/target/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/languagetool-commandline.jar'
