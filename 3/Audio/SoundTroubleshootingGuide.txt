Sound Troubleshooting Guide
for Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10, 12.04, and 12.10


Notes/Warnings/Tips about this document:
1. This is a do-it-yourself guide to fix your sound problems. I do not guarantee that it will work, but feel free to reply to this post if you have any problems.
2. Make sure that you have plenty of time to do this guide, as it will probably take a few hours.
3. Make sure that you have installed the latest updates for ubuntu before beginning this guide. 
4. All advice in this guide has been tested on Ubuntu. Though we have not tested thoroughly on Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu the advice is likely to work for these versions as well.
5. In this guide, a Terminal window will be frequently used, so make sure that you know how to copy and paste commands into it. Don't be too afraid to use it, as it's a very powerful tool, and in some cases (probably your sound problem), it's essential to use it.
6. Terminal commands are in a black background color, white text, and they have a Monospaced font.
7. Sample Terminal outputs are in a gray background color, black text, and they have a Monospaced font.
8. NOTE TO WRITERS: procedure and appendix X is just a temporary name for procedures/appendixes. Change it as soon as you have made the procedure/appendix.
9. If you have any problems with this post, feel free to reply, giving the information we need to be able to help your problem (referring to ‘Appendix X’, for example).
10. Procedure A's are for making sound work, and Procedure B's are for enhancing the sound (making MIDI work, removing noise etc...)
11. This guide is organized like a Choose Your Own Adventure, meaning that you do not read it in the order that it was written, but the order that the text gives you ("follow procedure X" etc...).
12. If you see similar text in the Terminal window:
[sudo] password for USERNAME:
Enter your password (nothing will be shown), and press ENTER
If it was mistyped, it will say:
Sorry, try again:
You have 3 tries to enter your password.


Preliminary checks and guide start:
Make sure that all of these things are OK (follow the checks in the order supplied):
1. Your speakers are turned on fully (on the speakers)
2. Your speakers are turned on fully (on AlsaMixer)
3. Your speakers are plugged into the correct ports.
4. If your speaker has a power cable, make sure that it is plugged in.
5. Your speakers work (try plugging them into a CD/DVD/Radio player)
6. Your Ubuntu release is supported. If it isn’t supported anymore, install a supported release of Ubuntu (clean install, not upgrade from the upgrade tool).
7. If your problem is NOT sound, but recording instead, check out Appendix G, and Appendix B, on the recording section. If it still doesn't work after tweaking the settings a lot, use procedure Af to reinstall ALSA.
8. If your problem is that the sound stops working after hibernation, follow procedure Ba.
9. If you want to make MIDI work, make sure that sound works normally, then follow procedure Bb.
10. Run the following command in a Terminal window:
speaker-test[a]
If it shows this something similar to this message:
Playback open error: -16,Device or resource busy
Reboot, and your sound should work! If not, repeat this guide, redoing the checks.
1. Boot into any supported Ubuntu LiveCD/DVD/USB, and see if sound works. If sound doesn’t work there, then the problem might be with Ubuntu, your sound card (or motherboard, if the sound card is internal), or the BIOS settings. Follow procedure X for more information.
2. Run the following command in a Terminal window:
aplay -l
If it gives an output similar to this:
aplay: device_list:221: no soundcard found...
Then follow procedure Aa.
If it gives an output similar to this:
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
ALSA lib conf.c:3643:(snd_config_update_r) Cannot access file /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
ALSA lib control.c:882:(snd_ctl_open_noupdate) Invalid CTL hw:0
aplay: device_list:249: control open (0): No such file or directory
Then follow procedure Ab.
If it does not give any of the 2 outputs (or similar to them), then follow procedure Ac.
1. Run the following command in a Terminal window:
lspci -nn | grep '\[04[80][13]\]'
If the command gives no output at all, follow procedure X.
If the command does give output, follow procedure Ac.




Procedure Aa (Fix Audio Permissions)
Run the following command in a Terminal window:
sudo aplay -l[b]
If it gives an output similar to this:
aplay: device_list:221: no soundcard found...
Then follow procedure Ac, and if sound still doesn’t work, repeat this guide (redoing the checks).
If it does not give that output (or similar to it), then type in a Terminal window:
sudo usermod -aG `cat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`
Then reboot, and run this command in a Terminal window:
aplay -l
You should see the devices now.
If still see the aplay: device_list:221: no soundcard found... output, then follow procedure Ac, and if sound still doesn’t work, repeat this guide (redoing the checks).
If you do see the devices, and sound doesn’t work, use AlsaMixer to unmute your audio, and set it to 100%.


Procedure Ab (Reinstall libasound2)
Run the following command in a Terminal window:
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libasound2
Your sound should work. If it doesn’t, repeat this guide (redoing the checks).


Procedure Ac (Make the system/ALSA recognize the sound card(s))
Run this in a Terminal window:
echo "Sound cards recognized by the system:"; lspci -nn | grep --color=none '\[04[80][13]\]'; echo "Sound cards recognized by ALSA:"; lspci -nn | grep '\[04[80][13]\]' | while read line; do lspci -nnk | grep -A 3 '\[04[80][13]\]' | grep -e 'Kernel modules: ..*' -e '\[04[80][13]\]' | grep --color=none -F "$line"; done; echo "Sound cards recognized by ALSA, and activated:"; lspci -nn | grep '\[04[80][13]\]' | while read line; do lspci -nnk | grep -A 3 '\[04[80][13]\]' | grep -e 'Kernel drivers in use: ..*' -e '\[04[80][13]\]' | grep --color=none -F "$line"; done
First, make sure that Ubuntu recognizes all of your soundcards. If it doesn’t, make sure that your sound card is properly placed in its slot (you can disregard this step if it is integrated into the motherboard), and make sure that the BIOS does not disable the sound card.
Then, make sure that ALSA recognizes all of the sound cards that Ubuntu recognizes. If it doesn’t recognize all of them, then follow this tutorial: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1681577. After that, reboot and re-run the big command in I Procedure Ac above, and it should be recognized.
Finally, make sure that all of the sound cards recognized by ALSA are activated. If they are not all activated, get the slot number of the card that is not activated (the first field, usually something in this format (can be letters or numbers): 00:00.0), and type in a Terminal window (replace SLOTID by the slot id of the sound card that is not activated. If you have more than one sound card, re-run this command as many times as needed, always replacing SLOTID):
DRIVER=`lspci -ks SLOTID | grep "Kernel modules:" | awk -F: '{print $2}' | sed 's/ *//g'`; modprobe $DRIVER && echo "$DRIVER" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
Reboot, re-run the big command in Procedure Ac above, and it should be activated!


Procedure Ad (Switch default sound card)
Run this in a Terminal window:
aplay -l
For me, it gave this output (yours will probably differ):
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: Generic [HD-Audio Generic], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: Generic_1 [HD-Audio Generic], device 0: VT1708S Analog [VT1708S Analog]
  Subdevices: 2/2
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
card 1: Generic_1 [HD-Audio Generic], device 1: VT1708S Digital [VT1708S Digital]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
Choose the card/device you want to have as the default card, then check the first part (card X:), and remember the bolded part. Then, check which card device you want to use (device Y:), and remember the bolded part.
Edit (or create) /etc/asound.conf with your favorite text editor (as root).
Put the following contents in it (replace X and Y by the card and device numbers you saw):
pcm.!default {
      type plug slave.pcm {
            type hw card X device Y
      }
}
Then save, exit and reboot.




Procedure Ae (Make NVIDIA HDMI Audio work)
Make sure that the proprietary NVIDIA drivers are installed by going here:


Ubuntu 11.10:        

Ubuntu 11.04:

Ubuntu 11.04 Classic or Ubuntu <= 10.10 (Name is either Hardware Drivers or Additional Drivers):

Kubuntu or KDE:


Xubuntu/XFCE:

Lubuntu/LXDE:

Then you should see a screen similar to this:

Then after a bit:

Select the one that says Recommended (If the one that says Recommended has a green circle, then skip the installation and rebooting):

Click on Activate, and this box might appear (of which you just enter your password):

Then a download box will appear:

Then after it is finished, reboot:

So restart your computer. After that, you'll need to do some Terminal work.


Run in a Terminal window:
aplay -l
You should see an output similar to this:
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC662 rev1 Analog [ALC662 rev1 Analog]
 Subdevices: 1/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 1: ALC662 rev1 Digital [ALC662 rev1 Digital]
 Subdevices: 1/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 3: NVIDIA HDMI [NVIDIA HDMI]
 Subdevices: 1/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 7: NVIDIA HDMI [NVIDIA HDMI]
 Subdevices: 1/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 8: NVIDIA HDMI [NVIDIA HDMI]
 Subdevices: 1/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 9: NVIDIA HDMI [NVIDIA HDMI]
 Subdevices: 0/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
If you do not see the NVIDIA cards, then follow procedure Ac.
grep "eld_valid *1" /proc/asound/NVidia/eld*
You should see something like this:
/proc/asound/NVidia/eld#X.0:eld_valid        1
X is a number between 0 and 3, and remember the bolded part.
Use this reference on what probe mask you should use:
eld#0.0=device 3, probe_mask=0x1
eld#1.0=device 7, probe_mask=0x2
eld#2.0=device 8, probe_mask=0x4
eld#3.0=device 9, probe_mask=0x8
So now, run your favorite text editor (as root), and edit /etc/modprobe.d/nvidiahdmi.conf
Add this line (replace 0xY by the Probe Mask number you saw for your device):
options snd-hda-intel probe_mask=0xY
Then save the document.
After that, run this Terminal command:
sudo update-initramfs -u
Then run your favorite text editor (as root) and edit /etc/pulse/default.pa
Find these lines:
### Load audio drivers statically (it's probably better to not load
### these drivers manually, but instead use module-hal-detect --
### see below -- for doing this automatically)
#load-module module-alsa-sink
#load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
#load-module module-oss device="/dev/dsp" sink_name=output source_name=input
#load-module module-oss-mmap device="/dev/dsp" sink_name=output source_name=input
#load-module module-null-sink
#load-module module-pipe-sink
Add at the end of it:
load-module module-alsa-sink device=hdmi:NVidia
Then save, and then run in a Terminal window:
rm -rf ~/.pulse ~/.asound* ~/.pulse-cookie
Then reboot.
If you still can't hear from the NVidia HDMI, then check out procedure Ad, and if it still doesn't work (after a reboot), try unmuting it with AlsaMixer.


Procedure Af (Reinstall ALSA safely)
Run in a Terminal window:
[ ! -f './purgeconfig.sh' ] && wget http://purgeconfig.sf.net/purgeconfig.sh && sudo bash ./purgeconfig.sh alsa=base alsa-utils linux-sound-base libasound2
WARNING: DO NOT RUN SYNAPTIC/APT/APTITUDE/DPKG/SOFTWARE CENTER WHILE ISSUING THIS COMMAND
Procedure Ag (Update/Reinstall Kernel)
Make sure that all official repos are enabled in the software sources.
Then type this into a Terminal window:
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
If it does NOT give you something similar to screen:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Calculating upgrade... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Press Y then ENTER.
Then type into a Terminal window:
sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-`uname -r`
Then reboot.


Procedure Ba (Fix ALSA Hibernating Issue)
Run your favorite text editor (as root) and edit /etc/pm/sleep.d/50alsa
Enter this text:
case "$1" in
       hibernate|suspend)
               # Stopping is not required
               ;;
       thaw|resume)
               /sbin/alsa force-reload
               ;;
       *) exit $NA
               ;;
esac
Then save and reboot.


Procedure Bb (Enable MIDI)
WARNING: This procedure is experimental and not for inexperienced Ubuntu users
Make sure that you have a MIDI port (either one of the two) on your sound card:


If you are sure that your sound card has a MIDI port, check the kernel driver of the sound card with the MIDI port by this command (note that this will list the kernel drivers of all of your sound cards, so make sure that you know which sound card has the MIDI port):
lspci -nnk | grep -A 3 '\[04[80][13]\]' | grep -e '\[04[80][13]\]' -e 'Kernel modules:' | sed 's/Kernel modules:/KERNEL DRIVER:/g'
After you have found the kernel driver for the sound card with the MIDI port, open /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf with your favorite text editor (as root).
Add the following line to it (replace KERNELDRIVER by the kernel driver for the sound card with the MIDI port. If you already have a line for KERNELDRIVER, add mpu_port=0x330 to it instead):
options KERNELDRIVER mpu_port=0x330
Save and close the file, then edit /etc/modules with your favorite text editor (as root), and add the following lines to it:
snd-seq
snd-seq-device
snd-seq-midi
snd-seq-midi-event
Save and close the file, then run this Terminal command:
sudo modprobe -a snd-seq snd-seq-device snd-seq-midi snd-seq-midi-event
Then reboot, and MIDI should work!




Appendixes
Appendix A (Opening a Terminal window)
Some users find it challenging to find the Terminal, so here is how you do it.
Shortcut for any Ubuntu distribution/version:
CTRL+ALT+T
Menu/Graphical way:
On Ubuntu 11.10:

On Ubuntu 11.04:

On Ubuntu 11.04 Classic, or Ubuntu 10.10 and earlier:

On Kubuntu or KDE:

On Xubuntu or XFCE:

On Lubuntu or LXDE:







Appendix B (Using AlsaMixer)
General
Run this command in a Terminal window:
alsamixer
This command should open up a mixer like in the screenshot:

The currently selected control is the one in the red text, surrounded by <>. Use the ← and → keys to change the currently selected control.
The volume is the green/white/red sliders. Use the ↑ and ↓ keys to change the volume. The current volume is underneath the box.
The box below the volume sliders is the status. If it has a green OO, then it’s not muted, but if you see a black MM, then it’s muted. The M key is to toggle mute/unmute.
The grey section is a section that cannot be changed, because of some reason or another.
To change the sound card you are working on, press F6. It should open up a box like this:

Use the ↑ and ↓ keys to choose the card, and press ENTER to select it.
The default setting mode is Playback (F3). Recording (F4), and All (F5) are also available.
To exit, press ESC.
Recording
Press F4 to go to the recording setting mode. Here is a screenshot running on my machine:

Recording problems almost always come from here (or if you didn't place the jacks correctly).
The first two options (might be more or less, depending on your sound card) are just boosts, so you'll have to play with them. The last three (again, might be more or less) options are the ones that create/fix the most problems. When it captures from a level, beneath the level you will see red CAPTURE text. To disable capturing it, select it, and press SPACE.
The Input Source can be changed using the ↑ and ↓ keys.


If you want to save your settings for the next reboot, type in a Terminal window (replace CARD by the card number that you are saving the settings from. You can find the card number on AlsaMixer, pressing F6):
sudo alsactl store CARD
Then to restore the settings you stored:
sudo alsactl restore


Appendix C (Using a text editor as root)
If you have Ubuntu (standard), run in a Terminal window (replace FILE by the name of the file you are editing):
gksu gedit FILE
Kubuntu/KDE (replace FILE by  the name of the file you are editing):
kdesudo kate FILE
Lubuntu/LXDE/Xubuntu/XFCE (replace FILE by the name of the file you are editing):
gksu leafpad FILE
If you want to use another graphical editor, you can use this command on GTK-based environments:
gksu EDITOR FILE
And on KDE:
kdesudo EDITOR FILE
Or if you use a command-line editor, simply use this:
sudo EDITOR FILE


Appendix D (Gather information needed to troubleshoot)
If the guide failed to help you with your sound problem, you can reply to this post[c].
Run the following command in a Terminal window:
wget http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh --upload;
It will give you a link, so add the link to your reply.


Appendix E (Copy and Paste Commands into the terminal)
Hold down your left mouse button and highlight the entire command, then right click and choose copy then place your cursor into the terminal window and right click and choose paste. 
If you like using menus, highlight the entire command, and select Edit->Copy in your web browser, and on the Terminal window, select Edit->Paste.
If you love shortcuts, you can highlight the entire command, and on the document, press CTRL+C, and on the Terminal window, press CTRL+SHIFT+V (note that I bolded SHIFT, because it will not behave as desired without it).


Appendix F (Make sure that the speakers are plugged in correctly)
One of the most common problems is that the speakers are not plugged in correctly, or the system wants to hear audio from the wrong speakers.





You might see different images beside the jacks, but the colors rarely change.
Usually you would like to plug your speakers plugged in the green jack.
Your microphone should almost always be plugged in the pink jack.
A useful way of finding what plug the jack belongs to is to match the color of the jack to the plug.


Appendix G (Enabling all sources)
Run in a Terminal window:
if (which software-properties-gtk > /dev/null 2>&1); then gksudo software-properties-gtk; else kdesudo software-properties-kde; fi
It should open up a window. On the first tab, make sure that these 4 are checked:

Click on , then make sure that these 4 are checked:

Then click on , then make sure that these 4 are checked:

Then you can safely exit  the program.
After your sound problem is fixed, you can safely revert the settings.

[c]Anonymous:
I've done the check list, but there is a blinking noise (white noise) when I increase all volume controls in alsamixer. http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=00e348a8a913aa40c0f9b48ccab58fa9d652aa06
[d]Radha Santadharma:
Thanks for the guide. 
 
When I return home I will try to get my sound back. 
 
Meself thinks it is the hardware. Maybe the left channel amp burned out.
[e]Peter Mohlmann:
Thanks for the guide brought back my sound
[f]Fundi Kiragu:
Cheers.. sorted me out with no issues .. used http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1681577 ... taken 3 days looking through other solutions ......
[g]Kiswono Prayogo:
thank you so much man ^^


just by adding snd-hda-intel (even if my soundcard is amd) to /etc/modules then restart solves my problem

[h]Anonymous:
Hello. I've been through most of the information provided but nothing seems to work for me, unfortunately. 
My information is at http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=0ebdcc09185fc4d5e8ee294da6507b7451b3aa72
________________
Joel Leclerc:
Hmm, ALSA doesn't seem to recognize your soundcard... let's try using snd-hda-intel, so run this (copy + paste) in a terminal window, then reboot:


modprobe snd-hda-intel; echo "snd-hda-intel" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules > /dev/null;


That command should not output anything. If it does, and if your sound doesn't work after a reboot, paste the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com/ and send the link here.
[i]Jacob Weeks:
So, my sound works, but only with the volume all the way up. If I press the volume down button 3 times, I can't hear anything. I looked in sound settings and apparently the volume button also affects the amplification setting as well. How can I fix this?
[j]Julio Figueroa:
This was educational and thank you for sharing. Finally have my audio well after a bad Pithos install.
