    Writing Introductions
        There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or assignment. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:
            establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic
            indicate a problem, controversy or a gap in the field of study
            define the topic or key terms
            state of the purpose of the essay/writing
            provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing
            Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions are listed below. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the categories under which the phrases are listed.

        Introductory sections for research dissertations, are normally much more complex than this and, as well as the elements above, may include the following: a synopsis of key literature/current state of knowledge, synopsis of methods, lists of research questions or hypotheses to be tested, significance of the study, recognition of the limitations of the study, reasons for personal interest in the topic.

    Referring to literature
                one important characteristic of academic writing is that all the sources of information that the writer has used need to be indicated, not just as a bibliography or list of references, but also in or alongside the text. in some cases the source will be the main subject of the sentence, in others the sources may be mentioned parenthetically (in brackets) or via a notation system (e.g. footnotes). the more common verbs and verb phrases used in academic writing for referring to sources are given below. note that different referencing systems are used in different disciplines. in the examples, the harvard in-text referencing system has been used. also note that the "author as subject" style is less common in the sciences.
                "ideally, your review should be evaluative and critical of the studies which have a particular bearing on your own. for example, you may think a particular study did not investigate some necessary aspect of the area, or that the authors failed to notice some problem with their results."

Being Critical
        As an academic writer, you are expected to be critical of the sources that you use. This essentially means questioning what you read and not necessarily agreeing with it just because the information has been published. Being critical can also mean looking for reasons why we should not just accept something as being correct or true. This can require you to identify problems with a writer's arguments or methods, or perhaps to refer to other people's criticisms of these. Constructive criticism goes beyond this by suggesting ways in which a piece of research or writing could be improved.

Reporting Results
        The standard approach to this section of a dissertation is to merely present the results, without elaborate discussion or comment. This does not mean that you do not need any text to describe data presented in tables and figures. Writers usually comment on the significant data presented in the tables and figures. This often takes the form of the location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content. This is normally followed by a statement or statements which point out and describe the relevant or significant data. All your tables should be numbered and given a title.
        More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under the heading: Results and Discussion.

        The term discussion has a variety of meanings in English. In academic writing, however, it usually refers to two types of activity: a) considering both sides of an issue, or question, b) considering the results of research and the implications of these. Discussion sections in dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex in terms of their elements. The most common elements and some of the language that is typically associated with them are listed below:
        Background information (reference to literature or to research aim/question)

        Explanations for results:
            There are several possible explanations for this result.
            These differences can be explained in part by the proximity of X and Y.

Discussions
    The term discussion has a variety of meanings in English. In academic writing, however, it usually refers to two types of activity: a) considering both sides of an issue, or question, b) considering the results of research and the implications of these. Discussion sections in dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex in terms of their elements. The most common elements and some of the language that is typically associated with them are listed below:

Writing Conclusions
    Conclusions are shorter sections of academic texts which usually serve two functions. The first is to summarise and bring together the main areas covered in the writing, which might be called "looking back"; and the second is to give a final comment or judgement on this. The final comment may also include making suggestions for improvement and speculating on future directions.
    In dissertations and research papers, conclusions tend to be more complex and will also include sections on significance of the findings and recommendations for future work. Conclusions may be optional in research articles where consolidation of the study and general implications are covered in the Discussion section. However, they are usually expected in dissertations and essays.

Writing Definitions
        In academic work students are often expected to give definitions of key words and phrases in order to demonstrate to their tutors that they understand these terms clearly. Academic writers generally, however, define terms so that their readers understand exactly what is meant when certain key terms are used. When important words are not clearly understood misinterpretation may result. In fact, many disagreements (academic, legal, diplomatic, personal) arise as a result of different interpretations of the same term. In academic writing, teachers and their students often have to explore these differing interpretations before moving on to study a topic.

    Giving Examples
        Writers may give specific examples as evidence to support their general claims or arguments. Examples can also be used to help the reader or listener understand unfamiliar or difficult concepts, and they tend to be easier to remember. For this reason, they are often used in teaching. Finally, students may be required to give examples in their work to demonstrate that they have understood a complex problem or concept.

        Many paragraphs in academic writing show development from general statements to specific details or examples. In most paragraphs, therefore, examples usually come after a more general statement, as in the short extract below.

        Many words can often acquire a more narrow meaning over time, or may come to be chiefly used in one special sense. A classic example of this practice is the word doctor. There were doctors (i.e., learned men) in theology, law, and many other fields beside medicine, but nowadays when we send for the doctor we mean a member of only one profession.

        Examples as the main information in a sentence:

        For example / instance, the word doctor used to mean a learned man.

        For example, Smith and Jones (2004) conducted a series of semi-structured interviews in ......

        Many diseases can result at least in part from stress, including: arthritis, asthma, migrane, headaches and ulcers.

    Classifying and Listing
        When we classify things, we group and name them on the basis of something that they have in common. By doing this we can understand certain qualities and features which they shares as a class. Classifying is also a way of understanding differences between things. In writing, classifying is often used as a way of introducing a reader to a new topic. Along with writing definitions, the function of classification may be used in the early part of an essay, or longer piece of writing. We list things when we want to treat and present a series of items or different pieces of information systematically. The order of a list may indicate rank importance.

    Describing Causes and Effects
        A great deal of academic work involves understanding and suggesting solutions to problems. At postgraduate level, particularly in applied fields, students search out problems to study. In fact, one could say that problems are the food for a significant proportion of academic activity. However, solutions cannot be suggested unless the problem is fully analysed, and this involves a thorough understanding of the causes. Some of the language that you may find useful for explaining causes and effects is listed below:

        Verbs expressing causality

        Lack of protein	may cause
        can lead to
        can result in	mental retardation.
        Low levels of chlorine in the body	can give rise to	high blood presssure.
        Much of the instability	stems from	the economic effects of the war.
        Kwashiorkor is a disease
        Beri-beri is a disease
        Scurvy is a disease	caused by
        resulting from
        stemming from	insufficient protein.
        vitamin deficiency.
        lack of vitamin C.
        Nouns expressing causality

        The most likely causes of X are poor diet and lack of exercise.

        A consequence of vitamin A deficiency is blindness.
        Physical activity is an important factor in maintaining fitness.
        Many other medications have an influence on cholesterol levels.
        Another reason why Xs are considered to be important is that .......

        Consequently,
        Because of this,
        As a result (of this),	when they grow up, it will probably be difficult for them to find work.
        Adverbial phrases expressing causality

        Stomach cancer in many cases may be associated with certain bacterial infections.
        A high consumption of seafood could be associated with infertility.
        There is some evidence that X may affect Y.

    Comparing and Contrasting
        By understanding similarities and differences between two things, we can increase our understanding and learn more about both. This usually involves a process of analysis, in which we compare the specific parts as well as whole. Comparison may also be a preliminary stage of evaluation. For example, by comparing specific aspects of A and B, we can decide which is more useful or valuable. Many paragraphs whose function is to compare or contrast will begin with an introductory sentence expressed in general terms. Note the introductory sentences below:
        Introductory Sentences: Differences

        X is different from Y in a number of respects.

        Young children learning their first language need simplified input. Likewise, low level adult L2 learners need graded input supplied in most cases by a teacher.

        Speech functions are less likely to be affected in women because the critical area is less often affected. A similar pattern emerges in studies of the control of hand movements.

    Writing about the Past
        Writing about the past in English is made diffcult by the rather complex tense system. However the phrases grouped below give an indication of the uses of the main tenses in academic writng. For a comprehensive explanation of the uses of the various tenses you will need to consult a good English grammar book. A good recommendation is Practical English Usage by Michael Swan, OUP.
        Time phrases associated with the use of the simple past tense (specific times or periods of time in the past completed)
