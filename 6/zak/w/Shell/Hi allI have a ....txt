Hi all

I have a real strange issue with installed Ubuntu 10.10.

Hardware:
- CPU: AMD Phenom(tm) 9750 Quad-Core Processor
- Mainboard: Crosshair II
- RAM : 8 GB
- Graphic: Asus EAH 6850 DirectCU (3x Monitor conected, working)
- RAID 0 2x750GB disk

Software
- KUbuntu 10.10. with latest updates and kernel grisu-linux 2.6.35-24-generic-pae
- Catalyst 10.12.

Problem description
- installed Ubuntu 10.10 from live CD (boot with Ubuntu Live CD works sometimes)
- After installation and reboot, screen remained black and boot stopped (after you select the kernel).
- as screen remainded black (cursor blinking), I wanted to reboot and pushed the power button
- surprisingly , boot continued....
- I realized then that at every boot, booting stops, looks like that after first initialization, KUbuntu goes into sleep

Work-around // to boot to KUbuntu I must now EACH TIME...
=> select boot kernel on grub
=> wait until first boot part finishes (about 10 sec) and until no HW activity is seen (blinking lamps)
=> screen goes black and cursor is blinking
=> then I must push power button, and the CD rom is detected
=> then I must push power button again, and HD is accessed and booting goes on

After those weird steps, Kubuntu starts and login works. 3 Monotors are working with compiz. all ok

Here my demesg:

Here some suspicious errors in syslog:
=> "spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7"
* Spurious interrupt is a hardware interrupt that is unwanted. They are typically generated by system conditions
such as electrical interference on an interrupt line or through incorrectly designed hardware.
Google says, probably not the cause, seems to be a mainboard problem, that occurs often on different boards
=> "HEST: Table is not found!"
google shows that a maverick bug report is open. seems not to be the reason
=> "input: Power Button as /devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXPWRBN:00/input/input1"
this could have to do with my problem, no clue yet what it means. something to do with udev?. Anybody an idea?
=> ERST: Table is not found!
seems to have to do something with ATI driver not compiled to the right kernel... this could be a real trace
- Google says... Maverick Meerkat is currnetly using xserver 1.8x and the ati driver does not support this
and soon there is going to be xserver 1.9x and then we need to wait till ati release an
ati driver that support the new xserver versions before a new fglrx driver be released.
- i try now... I try to edit /etc/default/grub
add "nomodeset noapic nolapic" in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
-- this did not change anything... same problem
