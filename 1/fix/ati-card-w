#If you get into situation where something crashes and you will not be able to fix things by using graphical user interface you can still get to command line. Firstly you can try pressing Ctrl+Alt+F<1-6>( chose number between 1 and 6). Another option is to enter “recovery mode” at boot that also gives you access to command line. So maybe you don't have reinstall entire OS.

#You get a list of installed packages with this:

dpkg --get-selections

#When you remove a packages with apt-get use “purge”:

sudo apt-get purge <package-name>

#Fglrx packages:

fglrx fglrx-amdccele

#Fglrx-update packages:

fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates

#Open source driver packages:

xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon

To install a package use good old:

$ sudo apt-get install <package-name>

If you really want the benefits of the proprietary driver then you could also download proprietary drivers directly from amd support site.

Inside the zip-file there is a run-installer. I suggest you create deb-file from that (more details and tips here and here)as then the driver is easier to remove if it doesn't work. If you have to do it all from command line then these are the steps:

Download the driver:

$ wget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.zip

Unzip the driver:

$ unzip amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.zip

Make the file executable:

$ chmod +x amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run

Create deb-file from the run-installer:

$ sudo ./amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/raring

This might give you an error as you might lack necessary packages. According to this site at least Precise needed these packages to be installed.

$ sudo apt-get install dh-make dh-modaliases execstack

Install the deb file (replace * sign with the real ending – to check the correct file name you can use ls -l command):

$ sudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb
