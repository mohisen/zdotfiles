Web2py is a web framework for rapid development of secure database driven web applications. It was originally created to address very specific teaching needs and went mainstream, now counting thousands of users both in the academic and in the business worlds. Web2py has been used for teaching University level web development courses in the United States, South America and Europe, for research projects of public utility, and for many business applications. In this talk we discuss the motivations behind web2py, why we think it is important to make web development easy, where we are and where we should be.
