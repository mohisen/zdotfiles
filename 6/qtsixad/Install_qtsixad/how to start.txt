Hi, sorry for the late reply

Don't care about the ubuntu documentation, it's very old (could be a fossil by now...)
Installing 'joystick' is *not* required.

Basically, here are the steps required to use Sixaxis, in bluetooth mode:

1 - Pair the Sixaxis to your bluetooth dongle
This is made by connecting the sixaxis over USB, with the bluetooth dongle on USB too (unless it's internal, of course).
You can check if the sixaxis is properly connected with 'lsusb', and the bluetooth dongle with 'hcitool dev'.
If all is ok, run:
Code:
sudo sixpair
And the sixaxis will be paired, first step completed. You can now remove the sixaxis from USB.

2 - Connect over bluetooth
Usually, if the sixaxis is paired, pressing the PS button should auto-connect the sixaxis (it has a udev rule).
If that doesnt happen, wait until it stops blinking (you can force it by using 'hcitool dc <mac>' [get <mac> using 'hcitool con']).
Then run:
Code:
sixad --stop
sixad --start
And press the PS button again. It *must* connect now. If not, consider it a bug and please report back to me.

One thing worth trying is edit '/etc/default/sixad' and change debug mode to 1 (DEBUG=1), so you can get more messages out of the sixad.

You can do all this without even starting the GUI. (QtSixA).
Use the GUI if you need to change profiles, or maybe to disconnect stuff.


btw, you may ask 'how do I know when the sixaxis is connected?'.
If you ran 'sixad --start' from the terminal, a message will printed everytime a device connects (sixaxis or keypad).
Unless you changed the default profile, the sixaxis should animate the leds (and rumble if supported).


I hope this clears up something
