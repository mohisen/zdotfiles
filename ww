Key departmental and university wide information is sent via NSU mail.\n    I plan our weekly e-lives for Tues. evenings at 7:00 PM EST.\n    "Walk carefully. Watch and listen to those who know the setting. Do not presume to know solutions or to provide preconceived recipes. Understand yourself as part of a larger whole." ~John Paul Lederach, The Moral Imagination\n    "We\'re either going to die together, or we\'re going to learn to live together, and if we\'re going to live together, we have to talk."   ~Eleanor Roosevelt\nCourse Description\n    From the Catalogue:  "This course outlines the substantive themes, history, origins, contexts, and philosophical foundations of conflict resolution, healing, peacemaking, and problem solving. Students will examine levels of interventions and processes in the field of conflict resolution. Offered all terms."\n    Students will explore the history and development of the field of conflict resolution. This includes the development of the field, and significant debates within. It further includes theories and concepts unique to our field, such as relative deprivation, basic human needs, structural violence, and multi-track diplomacy. Students will also be engaged in active discussion, as well as written and group analysis, of a variety of different conflicts. What methods have individuals, communities and societies used to resolve conflict? Has it worked? How do we know? Why or why not?\nCourse Outcomes and Objectives\n    * Students will be able to describe the\n        context and development of the field\n    * Students will be able to identify\n        common sources,\n        drivers, and\n        dynamics of conflict\n    * Students will be able to\n        + articulate,\n        + critically assess\n        + and appropriately apply theories of conflict resolution and peace building.\n    * Students will demonstrate\n        developing expertise in the application of conflict resolution and peace-building theories through case studies.\n    * Students will demonstrate\n        excellence in written and oral communication.\n    * Students will demonstrate\n        the ability, in writing and in vigorous debate, to use and apply conflict resolution concepts and theories to make sense of current 21[st] century trends in conflict. (Hence it is advisable to remain familiar with the current news, as it will likely be a part of class discussion.)\n    * Students will demonstrate\n        understanding of the values of our field,\n            to include a willingness to consider alternative views, first "doing no harm", nonviolence and equity.\n\nTeaching Philosophy\n    Each of you brings a rich background of diverse experience to this foundational course in conflict resolution.  What this means is that I can learn as much from you as you can from me, and that you can each learn from one another. An important insight of our field is that conflicts are inherently interdisciplinary, and so the experiences of others from completely different professional and cultural backgrounds are a vital aspect of any conflict resolution training.\n\nBearing the above in mind, a central methodology of this course is "Freirian dialogue".  Named for famed Brazilian "critical/liberation educator" Paulo Freire, the idea here is active, never passive, critically engaged learning in a community of equals.  With this in mind, your active participation and careful reading of each week\'s assignments will be essential to success in the course. Expect to be called on to contribute to discussion! Be ready to explain and support your views. Be ready to listen to views you don\'t hold.\n\nRequired Texts\nMiall, Hugh, Oliver Ramsbotham and Tom Woodhouse.  (2011).

This will ensure your ability to participate and therefore benefit from class.\n    NB:  students are responsible for ensuring that they have reliable access to technology!  This is an online course and thus requires a reliable internet connection!\n    Required Assignments\nPhD students\nAssignment I:  Book review (20 points) -- doctoral students are required to complete an extra assignment. This will be an analytical book review assessing the thesis of a book relevant to the field of conflict resolution. (See suggested list below.) This must not be a book you have read previously. You are required to get my approval IF the book is not on the list below.  SEE RUBRIC IN OUR BLACKBOARD SPACE UNDER "ASSIGNMENTS".\n\nAssignment II:  Choice Essay (30 points) -- for this assignment students are required to select one of a variety of questions about conflict resolution. The student will then critically and thoughtfully respond to that question in a well-written essay.  SEE RUBRIC IN OUR BLACKBOARD SPACE UNDER "ASSIGNMENTS".\n\nAssignment III:  Group Conflict Resolution Case Presentation (40 points) -- for this assignment, groups of 3 students (who have ideally grouped themselves according to professional background and/or area of specific interest in conflict resolution) will present on the resolution of a conflict of current urgency. The presentation will address the drivers, sources, and dynamics of the conflict. It will also offer clear possibilities, based in our readings and other conflict resolution theory and practice, for resolving the conflict.  SEE RUBRIC IN OUR BLACKBOARD SPACE UNDER "ASSIGNMENTS".\n\nNB:  the remaining points are participation. All points are out of 100 in total.\nAssignment II:  Group Conflict Resolution Case Presentation (40 points) -- for this assignment, groups of 3 students (who have ideally grouped themselves according to professional background and/or area of specific interest in conflict resolution) will present on the resolution of a conflict of current urgency.

SEE RUBRIC IN OUR BLACKBOARD SPACE UNDER "ASSIGNMENTS".\nNB:  the remaining points are participation. All points are out of 100 in total.\n\nScoring for assignments:\n    The Final Grade scale is as follows:\n    A= 94-100%\n    A- = 90-93%\n    B+ = 87-89\n    B = 84-86\n    B- = 80-83\n    C+ = 77-79\n    C = 73-76\n    C- = 70-72\n    F = 69 and below\n\nClass Participation:\n    Although emergencies come up, if you are not in class, you do not receive participation points. If technological problems prevent you from participating, you may not receive full credit.\n\nThe class will be comprised of instructor lectures, student presentations, conflict resolution exercises and activities, and discussion facilitations. All students will be expected to facilitate our discussions about the readings. To gain satisfactory to excellent participation credits, in addition to class attendance and participation in activities, during discussions, you should be able to do the following:\n* Be courteous to one another during your discussions.\n* Raise and answer questions related to the assigned readings.\n* Share ideas and insights relating to the topic.\n* Demonstrate scholarship by pointing out relevant data/research and signaling relationships to earlier discussions, readings, and/or current events.\n* Relate and synthesize ideas of others.\n* Help others develop their ideas and views.\nIf you are not able to join us on e-live you MUST do two activities to make up for your class absence.\n  + Listen to the recording on BlackBoard.\n  + Write a two-page response (single-spaced) posted to the discussion board sharing your thoughtful, reflective analysis of the e-live session and that week\'s readings.\n    The make-up work must be completed within one week of the missed class. Failure to complete these assignments will result in a loss of participation points!\nAssignment Tardiness Policy:\nIn order to be fair to your classmates who hand in assignments on time, please do not request an extension except for a major crisis (e.g. death in the family, severe illness). If you need to request an extension without penalty due to such emergencies, do so as early as you know you\'ll need it. Surprises are not welcome! Please be advised that points are taken off the over all grade for late assignments.  Please be sure to upload your paper into Assignment Box! I cannot accept papers via email. Contact Help Desk with any technical difficulties. You are well advised to not leave the upload to the last minute; we all know too well how uncooperative technology can be.\n\nPaper Presentation Guidelines:\n    Please be sure to upload your papers into Assignment Box. Provide a cover sheet for your papers with a heading (for name, class, and date) and a title. Use 12-pitch font. Editing and revision are crucial; therefore, please make sure that your assignments are thoroughly revised before handing them in. Points will be taken off of the paper if there are grammatical errors or paper formatting and citation formatting errors.\n\nAs I have alluded to you earlier concerning writing, any course which involves writing is as much about good technical and discipline-related content as it is about the mechanics of good writing. Points will be taken off for failure to follow APA/Chicago format, for errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and for other mechanical writing problems.\n***Please note that any time you make reference to the work of another author, even if you are paraphrasing the information, you must make in-text citations and provide a reference page at the end of your papers. This rule also applies to web-based information as well. Use the APA guidelines to assist you in the details of citation. I provide a brief handout on these details, but it would be to your advantage to secure the APA style guide for current and future use.\nHere is a link to our library\'s APA guide.\nDuring the course of the term before each major paper is due, I will save time in class to address questions and concerns. Please don\'t be shy to take advantage of these opportunities. They are a great opportunity to discuss your questions and the direction you wish to take with your papers! It\'s almost certain that if you have a question, a classmate of yours has the same question too!\nNSU/SHSS Writing Resources\nI am pleased to recommend the following writing resources for those students wishing to advance their writing skills, as this is a key to success in any graduate program, as well as professional life in both the scholarship and practice of conflict resolution. Relevant courses include Dr. Nixon\'s "Academic Writing" and Prof. Toumey\'s "The Interdisciplinary Writer".\n\nPlease also be aware that Prof. Toumey offers individual and small-group editing and feedback both residentially and online. Residential students can also visit the NSU Writing Center in the Parker Building.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nIn academia, plagiarism is a `cardinal sin.\' For good reason -- as people plagiarize, they rob authors of their original ideas and whether one plagiarizes from a known author or from a friend, it is all cheating. Penalties for instances of plagiarism can range from failing an assignment to failing the entire course. Repeat offenses may result in expulsion from the program. Thus, it is extremely important that you familiarize yourselves with what constitutes cheating through plagiarism or improper citation of sources resulting in plagiarism -- whether intentionally or not.\n\n  TURNITIN.COM\n    For the major assignments of this class students must sign in and submit their work to both the appropriate Assignment Box in BlackBoard and the assignment box in www.turnitin.com. Turnitin.com is a website that enables professors and students alike to keep a check on possible conscious or unconscious violations of the copyrights of the ideas and work of others -- think of it as a "spell check" for plagiarism.  This is a tool for YOU to continue learning proper citation. Papers which are not submitted to Turnitin.com will lose points!\n\n    To sign up for this class in turnitin.com use the following Class ID and password:\n\n    ID:  6818994\n    Password:  foundations\n\nAttendance, Drop, Withdrawal, & Incomplete Policy\nThe dates for withdrawing from a course are identified on the Academic Calendar.  Withdrawal from a course before the last date for withdrawing shall lead to a W being placed for that course on the transcript. If a student never attends or actively participates in a course, per university registrar guidelines, the instructor must enter an "unearned" failing grade (F, NP) and 0.0 hours attended in WebSTAR.  A student will only be permitted to petition and receive consideration for a retroactive drop, withdrawal, or refund for a course more than 30 days after the end of the term if he or she has extremely extenuating circumstances and provides the appropriate documentation (e.g., medical records, death in family, etc.).\nPLEASE NOTE:  No student who has an outstanding Incomplete may be granted another Incomplete. No student with a GPA less than 3.0 may be granted an Incomplete.\nA student must make a formal, written request for an Incomplete grade for family and other approved emergencies, unless there is an unexpected medical emergency. A student may request an Incomplete, or "I" grade, for a period of one semester only. Students must submit the Incomplete request form to the DCAR Program Coordinator two weeks before the end of the semester.  The Incomplete request form will then be sent to the instructor to obtain the instructor\'s consent and signature. Upon approval, the form will include a detailed description of the work that needs to be completed. Faculty shall not be allowed to initiate "I" grades. They must assign a letter grade of "F" if a student has not filed an "I" request and has not completed the class assignments by the time grades are due. Please check with the Program Coordinator and your respective Director if you have questions about this policy.\nDisability Considerations\nNOVA is required to follow the Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding the provision to provide reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.  Therefore, if you have a disability that will negatively impact your performance in this course NOVA MUST provide you with any needed instructional and/or examination accommodation.  If you need additional assistance please contact me ASAP.  Also, you will need to contact the Office of Student Disability Services at (954) 262-7185 or visit: http://www.nova.edu/disabilityservices/studentinfo.html\n\nCourse Evaluations\nA couple of weeks before the term ends, you will be sent an e-mail requesting that you evaluate the course. Please take time to fill this out so that we can know your thoughts of the course and my teaching. However, you need not wait until the end of the course to let me know if you are facing problems or issues during the class. I ask that you engage such discussions in a respectful manner, having weighed all of the issues concerning your assignments before approaching me. Though your classmates will serve as a critical support group during the term, it is important for you to communicate with me directly when you are having difficulty with course material. I welcome feedback on course matters.\n\nNote:  all assignment due dates are considered to be the date during the indicated week on which we have class. Thus since our e-live is Tues., the due date will be the Tues. of that week.\n\nSchedule of Activities\n        Week 1:  Aug 27, 2013:  Welcomes, introduction to the course and a history of the field\n        Activity of the Week:  Be prepared to introduce yourself and to participate actively and thoughtfully in our introductory e-live!\n\n        Reading:  Declaration of Seville\n\n        Week 2: Sept 3, 2013:  Development of the field of conflict resolution\n        Activity of the Week:  Be prepared to participate thoughtfully and actively in our e-live!\n\n        Readings:\n        Ramsbotham et al, Ch 1-2\n\n        Burton, John.

What this means is that I can learn as much from you as you can from me, and that you can each learn from one another. An important insight of our field is that conflicts are inherently interdisciplinary, and so the experiences of others from completely different professional and cultural backgrounds are a vital aspect of any conflict resolution training.\n', '\n', 'Bearing the above in mind, a central methodology of this course is "Freirian dialogue".  Named for famed Brazilian "critical/liberation educator" Paulo Freire, the idea here is active, never passive, critically engaged learning in a community of equals.  With this in mind, your active participation and careful reading of each week\'s assignments will be essential to success in the course. Expect to be called on to contribute to discussion!

For good reason -- as people plagiarize, they rob authors of their original ideas and whether one plagiarizes from a known author or from a friend, it is all cheating. Penalties for instances of plagiarism can range from failing an assignment to failing the entire course. Repeat offenses may result in expulsion from the program. Thus, it is extremely important that you familiarize yourselves with what constitutes cheating through plagiarism or improper citation of sources resulting in plagiarism -- whether intentionally or not.\n", '\n', '  TURNITIN.COM\n', '    For the major assignments of this class students must sign in and submit their work to both the appropriate Assignment Box in BlackBoard and the assignment box in www.turnitin.com.

The Incomplete request form will then be sent to the instructor to obtain the instructor\'s consent and signature. Upon approval, the form will include a detailed description of the work that needs to be completed. Faculty shall not be allowed to initiate "I" grades.

What this means is that I can learn as much from you as you can from me, and that you can each learn from one another.

For good reason -- as people plagiarize, they rob authors of their original ideas and whether one plagiarizes from a known author or from a friend, it is all cheating. Penalties for instances of plagiarism can range from failing an assignment to failing the entire course. Repeat offenses may result in expulsion from the program.

The Incomplete request form will then be sent to the instructor to obtain the instructor\'s consent and signature. Upon approval, the form will include a detailed description of the work that needs to be completed. Faculty shall not be allowed to initiate "I" grades.

What this means is that I can learn as much from you as you can from me, and that you can each learn from one another.

For good reason -- as people plagiarize, they rob authors of their original ideas and whether one plagiarizes from a known author or from a friend, it is all cheating. Penalties for instances of plagiarism can range from failing an assignment to failing the entire course. Repeat offenses may result in expulsion from the program. Thus, it is extremely important that you familiarize yourselves with what constitutes cheating through plagiarism or improper citation of sources resulting in plagiarism -- whether intentionally or not.\n", '\n', '  TURNITIN.COM\n', '    For the major assignments of this class students must sign in and submit their work to both the appropriate Assignment Box in BlackBoard and the assignment box in www.turnitin.com. Turnitin.com is a website that enables professors and students alike to keep a check on possible conscious or unconscious violations of the copyrights of the ideas and work of others -- think of it as a "spell check" for plagiarism.

A student will only be permitted to petition and receive consideration for a retroactive drop, withdrawal, or refund for a course more than 30 days after the end of the term if he or she has extremely extenuating circumstances and provides the appropriate documentation (e.g., medical records, death in family, etc.).\n', 'PLEASE NOTE:  No student who has an outstanding Incomplete may be granted another Incomplete.

A student may request an Incomplete, or "I" grade, for a period of one semester only. Students must submit the Incomplete request form to the DCAR Program Coordinator two weeks before the end of the semester.  The Incomplete request form will then be sent to the instructor to obtain the instructor\'s consent and signature. Upon approval, the form will include a detailed description of the work that needs to be completed. Faculty shall not be allowed to initiate "I" grades.

I ask that you engage such discussions in a respectful manner, having weighed all of the issues concerning your assignments before approaching me.

If a student never attends or actively participates in a course, per university registrar guidelines, the instructor must enter an "unearned" failing grade (F, NP) and 0.0 hours attended in WebSTAR.  A student will only be permitted to petition and receive consideration for a retroactive drop, withdrawal, or refund for a course more than 30 days after the end of the term if he or she has extremely extenuating circumstances and provides the appropriate documentation (e.g., medical records, death in family, etc.).\n', 'PLEASE NOTE:  No student who has an outstanding Incomplete may be granted another Incomplete. No student with a GPA less than 3.0 may be granted an Incomplete.\n', 'A student must make a formal, written request for an Incomplete grade for family and other approved emergencies, unless there is an unexpected medical emergency. A student may request an Incomplete, or "I" grade, for a period of one semester only. Students must submit the Incomplete request form to the DCAR Program Coordinator two weeks before the end of the semester.  The Incomplete request form will then be sent to the instructor to obtain the instructor\'s consent and signature. Upon approval, the form will include a detailed description of the work that needs to be completed. Faculty shall not be allowed to initiate "I" grades. They must assign a letter grade of "F" if a student has not filed an "I" request and has not completed the class assignments by the time grades are due. Please check with the Program Coordinator and your respective Director if you have questions about this policy.\n', 'Disability Considerations\n', 'NOVA is required to follow the Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding the provision to provide reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.  Therefore, if you have a disability that will negatively impact your performance in this course NOVA MUST provide you with any needed instructional and/or examination accommodation.  If you need additional assistance please contact me ASAP.  Also, you will need to contact the Office of Student Disability Services at (954) 262-7185 or visit: http://www.nova.edu/disabilityservices/studentinfo.html\n', '\n', 'Course Evaluations\n', 'A couple of weeks before the term ends, you will be sent an e-mail requesting that you evaluate the course. Please take time to fill this out so that we can know your thoughts of the course and my teaching. However, you need not wait until the end of the course to let me know if you are facing problems or issues during the class. I ask that you engage such discussions in a respectful manner, having weighed all of the issues concerning your assignments before approaching me. Though your classmates will serve as a critical support group during the term, it is important for you to communicate with me directly when you are having difficulty with course material. I welcome feedback on course matters.\n', '\n', 'Note:  all assignment due dates are considered to be the date during the indicated week on which we have class.
