Crash Course: Using Corpus Linguistics to Enrich Language Learning
by Corrine Spencer
"Although this method is growing in popularity, many educators still struggle with incorporating corpus materials into language lessons, often because they do not feel confident or have not been introduced to the materials properly. In my own experience, educators I have spoken with listed most commonly that it seemed time consuming, that they didnâ€™t feel comfortable enough with grammar, or that the sites currently available were too difficult to use.  However, using a linguistic corpus in the classroom leads to deeper understanding of language use through guided exploration for both educator and student.  They are challenged to research word use in-context and are guided through or develop their own classifications and grammar rules using real linguistic data.  In addition, with some practice, educators can develop materials appropriate across many levels of language learning. It is obvious that a simple crash course and examples are needed, rather than papers on the usefulness-educators are available of the usefulness, but unable to navigate the materials. 
Attendees will learn to navigate the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) through hands-on experience by participating in an intermediate-level language exercise using COCA to develop understanding of the use of vocabulary and grammar. 
This workshop will show instructors how COCA can be used to develop deep semantic understanding of new words , and explore classification systems, as well as the variations of language use common in both colloquial and academic English. In addition, attendees will be guided through the creation of exercises using the lexical approach and popular literature in the form of templates/cheats developed for my own classroom to show the practical and free method of developing their own literacy and communication exercises to be used with any text, including transcriptions.
