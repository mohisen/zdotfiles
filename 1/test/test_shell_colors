So assuming the objective is to get both of these to run at 256 colors.

Type these commands and post your results:
1. "tput colors". This will report how many colors your terminal is using.
2. "echo $TERM". This will tell you what terminal you are using.
3. "echo $COLORTERM". If you are using a gnome you should see "gnome-terminal"
