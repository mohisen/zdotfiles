1) Uploads through a form. The database has a "file" field of type "upload" which I store using:

db.allfiles.insert(filename=filename, \ 
    file=db.allfiles.file.store(file.file,filename),user=me) 
This creates a file with a unique string attached to its name in the uploads directory. This solution is pretty easy.


2) I also need to store files that come in as strings via JSON call. I am not sure how to create "upload" type files and give them unique names in the uploads directory. Can anyone give any insight?

Thanks

I think you can just the incoming data, turn it into an in-memory stream and store it like you do at 1)

import StringIO
fileHandle = StringIO.StringIO ( JSONvar )
