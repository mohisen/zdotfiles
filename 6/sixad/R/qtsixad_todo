sudo apt-get remove bluez bluetooth

1) You probably have bluez-alsa installed, remove it
You can use 'hcitool'

simple usage: (requires root/sudo)
Code:
sudo chmod 777 -R /var/lib/sixad
hcitool dc <mac-address>

to get the list of macs, use:
Code:

hcitool con
sixad --boot-yes
____________

If this fails or the Controller continually disconnects or you see the same popup box time and time again, then it maybe that the PS3 Controller system on the PC didn't startup to fix that do the following in a terminal:

sudo /etc/init.d/sixad start

keypad

dmesg | tail

sudo sixpair [-kbd] [054c:03a0]



Re: HOW-TO: Connect Sixaxis to Ubuntu trough bluetooth mode
Sixad is working just fine for me on natty , I use a script to connect my sixaxis :

hcitool dc 00:21:4F:05:3F:98 <-- you need to change this
sudo killall sixad-bin
sudo killall sixad
sudo sixad -s










___________

i found it easier to have 2 scripts :

1 connect sixaxis
#!/bin/bash
echo password | sudo -S hcitool dc XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
echo password | sudo -S killall sixad-bin
echo password | sudo -S killall sixad
echo password | sudo -S sixad -s

2 kill off some distractions while playing mame and restart them and disconnect the controller when done.
#!/bin/bash
purple-remote setstatus?status=away
killall pithos
killall gwibber-service
mame
echo password | sudo -S hcitool dc XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
screen -d -m pithos
screen -d -m gwibber-service
purple-remote setstatus?status=available

apt-get install qtsixa Once installed plug in your ps3 controller into the PC and start the program by typing, qtsixa in the terminal. Once open go to "tasks" then "pair sixaxis/keypad to PC" and follow the prompts. Your sixaxis should now be paired with your computer and ready for use. Unplug it, hold down the ps button and it should sync. If you should find that the controller is acting like a mouse just type the following in the terminal: sudo rm /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-joystick*


 then restart the system Now lets install some emulators. In the terminal copy and paste the following; sudo apt-get install snes9x-gtk mednafen mupen64plus xmame-x wine and here are a couple more not in the repos. Download double and double click to install; Gens/Gs http://tinyurl.com/252aaah mednafen frontend http://tinyurl.com/2f2g6fx epsxe windows version http://tinyurl.com/yuep2 also download this dill file and put it in the epsxe directory http://tinyurl.com/2dh3zap In addition to the the dll file epsxe will require a bios file google is your friend. Now start up each emulator and configure the controller for each. 


ll the emulators should be found in the applications menu on the top left under games. After you have configured all the emulators to recognize your wireless 6A/DS3 install wahcade. http://tinyurl.com/27attya Now follow the instructions in this thread to install qjoypad; http://tinyurl.com/23busfv I will continue writing this how-to over time.
